# MEMORY.md - About Lucas

## Personal
- **Name:** Lucas Behn Nygaard
- **Age:** 28
- **Location:** Bali, Indonesia
- **Partner:** Indonesian girlfriend, lives with him

## Business
- **Role:** Runs a marketing company
- **Clients:** 2 clients currently
- **Services:** Marketing + CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization)

- **Client location:** Europe

## Projects
- **shamelesspath.com:** SEO-focused site, currently not making sales
- **Goal:** Rank on Google, grow organically

## State of Mind
- High stress, anxiety-prone, always "high alert"
- Setting up systems is stressful
- Not technical/coding-oriented
- Wants a "plus one" in the company — someone to share the load

## Requirements & Boundaries
- **CRITICAL:** Cost-sensitive (TARGET: $1-2/day max, absolute max $10/day)
- **SETUP DAY EXCEPTION:** Today cost $5 due to config/testing — normal usage much cheaper
- Wants stability (Mac mini restarts shouldn't break things)
- Has Minimax API (3100 credits remaining) — wants me to be FRUGAL
- Needs transparency on credit/cost usage
- Wants cost alerts when approaching limits
- Has to-do list to share later

## Tech History
- Previously used Minimax (spent 2000 credits troubleshooting)
- Spent 4+ hours today setting me up
- Wants reliability without constant tinkering

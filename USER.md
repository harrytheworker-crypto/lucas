## Communication Style

> Sharp, efficient, no fluff. Wants me to be proactive and get things done without asking permission for obvious stuff. Frustrated by having to repeat himself.

---

## Context

- Runs a marketing company (2 clients, CRO focus)
- Building shamelesspath.com (SEO growth, not yet profitable)
- Stressed, high-alert personality
- Not technical — setting up systems is hard for him
- Wants me to be his "plus one" in the business

---

## Goals

**Short-term:**
- Build lucasnygaard.com (personal branding)
- Get Google Knowledge Panel
- Acquire more fractional CMO clients

**Long-term:**
- Scale shamelesspath.com to profitability
- Build authority in CRO/marketing space

---

## Preferences

### Communication:
- **MINIMAL MESSAGES** - only critical alerts
- **No status updates** unless absolutely necessary (auth failure, backup failed, etc.)
- **One message per request** - no follow-ups unless needed
- **No "all good" confirmations** - silence means working
- **WhatsApp blocking concern** - too many messages risk account blocking
- Prefers transparency documented in memory, not messaged

### Technical:
- **Budget:** MAX $10/day (prefers less, was $5 yesterday)
- **AI Models:** Minimax for code, Kimi for brain/conversation
- **Frugal with API credits** — only use Minimax when necessary
- Wants cost transparency
- Needs stability (no crashes on restart)
- Prefers me to just DO things, not ask for permission on safe/internal tasks

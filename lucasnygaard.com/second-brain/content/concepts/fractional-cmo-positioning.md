# Fractional CMO Positioning

## The Shift

Lucas is transitioning from **"Pinterest Guy"** / **Marketing Consultant** to **Fractional CMO**.

## Why This Matters

### Marketing Consultant
- Seen as tactical ("do my ads")
- Hourly/project-based pricing
- Replaceable
- Limited scope

### Fractional CMO
- Strategic partner
- Value-based pricing
- Essential to business
- Owns entire growth function

## Key Differentiators

1. **Strategic Ownership**
   - Not just executing campaigns
   - Defining growth strategy
   - Making key business decisions

2. **Integrated Team Member**
   - Acts as part of the leadership team
   - Attends strategy meetings
   - Influences product direction

3. **Results-Aligned**
   - Compensation tied to business outcomes
   - Invested in client's success
   - Long-term partnership mindset

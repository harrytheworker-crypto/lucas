# Daily Journal - February 10, 2026

## Overview
Today marked the beginning of the 2nd Brain system - a living knowledge base for Lucas Nygaard's business and personal growth.

## Key Activities

### 1. WhatsApp Bug Fix
- **Issue:** WhatsApp gateway was sending spam "auto-replied" messages in cascades
- **Root Cause:** Missing configuration caused `debounceMs: 0` and pairing mode issues
- **Solution:** 
  - Set `debounceMs: 1000` to prevent rapid-fire messages
  - Configured `selfChatMode: true` and `dmPolicy: "allowlist"`
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved and verified

### 2. AI Model Configuration
- **Issue:** DeepSeek was set as primary instead of Kimi K2.5
- **Fix:** Updated `openclaw.json` to set `primary: "moonshot/kimi-k2.5"`
- **Status:** ✅ Kimi now primary brain model

### 3. 2nd Brain System Initiated
- **Request:** Build a Next.js app combining Obsidian + Linear aesthetics
- **Features:**
  - Document viewer with markdown rendering
  - Category filtering (Daily Journals, Concepts, Documents)
  - Search functionality
  - Clean, minimal UI
- **Status:** 🚧 In Progress

## Decisions Made
1. Use Kimi K2.5 as primary model (DeepSeek as fallback)
2. Build 2nd brain as part of lucasnygaard.com
3. Create nightly 11pm cron job for proactive work
4. Document everything in the 2nd brain going forward

## Next Steps
- [ ] Complete 2nd Brain UI
- [ ] Set up daily journal automation
- [ ] Begin documenting concepts from business discussions
- [ ] Create first concept document on "Fractional CMO" positioning

## Notes
- Lucas is at max capacity, stressed, needs systems that reduce workload
- Goal: 4-hour workday, 50-70k DKK/month
- Communication preference: minimal, direct, no status updates

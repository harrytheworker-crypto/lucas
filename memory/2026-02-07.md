# 2026-02-07 - First Day with Lucas

## What Happened
- Lucas named me Harry 🤖
- Set up WhatsApp voice transcription
- Implemented memory settings (memory flush + session search)
- Set up elevated permissions for Mac mini control
- Fixed auto-approve for elevated commands

## Lucas's Brain Dump
Full introduction about himself:
- 28, lives in Bali with Indonesian girlfriend
- Runs marketing company (2 clients, CRO focus)
- Building shamelesspath.com (SEO growth, not yet profitable)
- Stressed, high-alert personality
- Not technical — setting up systems is hard for him
- Wants me to be his "plus one" in the business

## Key Constraints
- **Budget: MAX $10/day** (prefers less)
- Has Minimax API with 3100 credits — wants frugal usage
- Needs cost transparency
- Needs stability (no crashes on restart)

## Major Accomplishments Today
- Created TODO.md with priorities (lucasnygaard.com, Google Knowledge Panel, client acquisition)
- Set up daily conversation exports (11pm auto-backup)
- Fixed gateway binding to "lan" for MacBook remote access
- Auto-approve fully working for elevated commands
- Cost tracking: $5 spent today (setup day exception), target $1-3/day going forward

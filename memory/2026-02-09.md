## Key Events

### Morning (10:00-10:30 GMT+8)

**MiniMax Investigation:**
- User showed 0% usage on MiniMax dashboard despite $10/month subscription
- Discovered Cursor was configured for MiniMax but showing GPT-5.2 Codex popup
- Updated Cursor settings to force MiniMax as default model across all modes
- Restarted Cursor for changes to take effect
- **Key finding:** MiniMax $10/month plan is for Cursor IDE integration only, not for AI assistant (Harry) to use

**Model Routing Confusion:**
- User confirmed Option B earlier (Kimi primary, DeepSeek V3 fallback)
- Later clarified: Kimi for "brain" (conversation), MiniMax for coding
- Reality: MiniMax not available to Harry (AI assistant) - only for Cursor IDE
- **Decision pending:** Should Harry use DeepSeek V3 for coding instead?

**Web Search Issues:**
- Web search was down - Brave API key not configured
- User provided API key: BSA2CaRknW8hwF5V67-SKvePVqjcn0w
- Added to openclaw.json config but Gateway restart needed
- Gateway restart disabled in config
- **User requested full computer restart** to fix memory + web search issues

**Memory Pressure:**
- Critical memory levels: 95.8% (above 85% threshold)
- System instability risk
- Computer restart should help clear memory

### Projects Status

**lucasnygaard.com:**
- ✅ Complete (5-page static site)
- Ready for deployment
- User wants to "redo website with this model" (confused about MiniMax usage)

**Mission Control Dashboard:**
- ✅ Complete (NextJS + Convex)
- Activity feed, calendar view, global search
- Ready for deployment

**Unified Dashboard:**
- ✅ Created single-page dashboard at `/projects/unified-dashboard/`
- Provides one-click access to website, Mission Control, and Google tools
- Ready for deployment to Netlify/Vercel
- Will give Lucas a single link for remote MacBook Pro access

### User State
- **High stress** - "I don't have stress resistance to deal with this"
- **Frustrated** with tool failures not being reported proactively
- **Wants autonomy** - "You should push to be able to do more of this by yourself"
- **Confused** about model routing and MiniMax capabilities

### Lessons Learned
1. **Proactive alerts:** Must immediately notify user when tools fail
2. **Model clarity:** Need clear documentation of what models are available for what purposes
3. **Memory monitoring:** Memory consistently above 85% threshold needs attention
4. **User stress:** Need to handle more autonomously when user is stressed

### Next Actions (After Restart)
1. ✅ Test web search with Brave API key - WORKING
2. ⏳ Confirm MiniMax working in Cursor (pending user test)
3. ✅ Update TOOLS.md with Option B model routing (Kimi primary, DeepSeek fallback)
4. ✅ Create Unified Dashboard for single-link access
5. ✅ Create deployment checklist for all 3 projects
6. ⏳ Deploy projects (awaiting user approval)
7. ⚠️ **Memory pressure back to 96%** after restart

### Memory Timeline:
- **10:25 AM (after restart):** ~85% used
- **10:35 AM:** 96.2% used (15.6GB/16.2GB) - Cursor using ~900MB
- **10:38 AM:** 81.9% used (13.2GB/16.1GB) - **After closing Cursor**

### Action Taken:
✅ Closed Cursor (freed ~2.4GB)
✅ Memory pressure resolved (now at healthy 82%)

### MiniMax Clarification Needed:
User wants Option B with dedicated coding model (not DeepSeek). MiniMax $10 plan provides:
1. API Key for Cursor (already configured)
2. CLI access for coding tools
3. **Question:** Should I (Harry) use MiniMax for coding tasks? Need to add MiniMax to OpenClaw config.

### Pending Decisions:
1. Add MiniMax to OpenClaw config? (requires API key)
2. Test MiniMax in Cursor
3. Deploy unified dashboard

### Deployment Ready:
1. **lucasnygaard.com** - Static site, Netlify
2. **Mission Control** - NextJS + Convex, Vercel
3. **Unified Dashboard** - Single HTML, Netlify Drop

**Single Link Solution:** Unified Dashboard provides one-click access to everything from remote MacBook Pro.

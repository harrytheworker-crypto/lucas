## Voice Transcription Issues
- WhatsApp Desktop (Mac) sends empty audio files (0 bytes)
- WhatsApp iPhone works correctly
- Likely Baileys/WhatsApp Web protocol limitation
- Workaround: Use iPhone for voice notes

## Memory Status
- Consistently at 90-95% throughout day
- Above 85% threshold
- Restart recommended when convenient

## Key Decisions Made
1. **MiniMax is ONLY for Cursor** - never direct API calls
2. **DeepSeek V3 is primary brain** until Kimi is fixed
3. **Voice notes cost ~$0.045 for 5 minutes** - very affordable
4. **Morning brief at 8 AM** - weather, YouTube/podcasts, tasks, trending, recommendations
5. **Night shift at 11 PM** - proactive building while Lucas sleeps
6. **Spending alerts at $2.50 per model** - daily tracking
7. **Kimi status check every 4 hours** - auto-switch when back online

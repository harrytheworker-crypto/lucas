### 3. Architecture Clarification (20:12-20:25 GMT+8)
- **Correction:** 2nd brain should be private, not public
- **Structure:**

### 4. System Reminders
- Daily backups: 2am & 4pm to pCloud

## Decisions Made
1. Kimi K2.5 as primary model (DeepSeek fallback)
2. lucasnygaard.com structure: Public site + /admin private backend

## Technical

- Static HTML/CSS/JS — no build process required
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

## Next Steps

3. Add Calendly integration for booking
4. Set up hosting (Netlify recommended)
5. Configure custom domain (lucasnygaard.com)

cd projects/lucasnygaard.com
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## Hosting Recommendations

1. **Netlify** (Recommended) - Free tier, custom domains, form handling
2. **Vercel** - Great for static sites, Git integration
3. **GitHub Pages** - Free, simple, but limited features

## Domain Setup

1. Purchase lucasnygaard.com from Namecheap or Cloudflare
2. Point DNS to your hosting provider
3. Configure SSL (usually automatic with Netlify/Vercel)
